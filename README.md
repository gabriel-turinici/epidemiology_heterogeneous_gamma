# heterogeneous_recovery_rate
This code simulates the dynamics of the SIR model with heterogeneous recovery rates (gamma). 

It ia companion implementation of paper https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13130

By running the provided examples, it demonstrates two counter-examples showing that herd immunity 
cannot be achieved when the mean recovery time (the mean of 1/gamma) is not finite. 
 The results highlight the critical role of recovery time heterogeneity in epidemic modeling.
